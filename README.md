# P.R.I.M.E.

Pretty Rad Interactive Modular Elements.

Made with ❤️ at Viam.

## Getting started

PRIME is a collection of atomic UI elements, designed to "just work" in any HTML-based environment, regardless of framework or lack thereof. It is a web component library.

## Installation

The PRIME NPM package contains the following necessary exports for usage:

- `prime.es.js` or `prime.umd.js` - JS that defines custom elements. ES modules are recommended over UMD.
- `prime.css` - stylesheet shared by all elements.

If using ES modules, import Prime's JS file into your code:

```ts
import '@viamrobotics/prime';
```

You must host `prime.css` in a static file server. This is every prime element loads it as a shared stylesheet.

If you are not hosting `prime.css` at the root directory of your domain, you will need to add a PRIME_CONFIG global variable before loading the JS file:

```html
<script type="module">
  window.PRIME_CONFIG = {
    base: '/path/to/static/folder',
    query: '?v=someCacheBustingHashIfNeeded',
  };
</script>
```

If the necessary `.css` and `.js` files have been added, then no additional imports are needed!
You can immediately start adding PRIME elements to your app, since prime elements are simply custom HTML elements:

```html
<v-button label="Hello world!" />
```

All elements are prefixed with `v-`. This stands for Viam, the cool company where these elements are made.

## Playground

To use the playground, go to the `playground` directory, and:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

Or to run in production mode:

```bash
npm run build
npm run serve
```

## Linting / Testing

To lint and typecheck:

```bash
npm run lint
npm run check
```

To test:

```bash
npm run test-dev # to test with the playwright debug UI
# or
npm run test # to test in headless mode

# to run specific tests
npm run test <test-name> # for <test-name>.spec.ts
```
