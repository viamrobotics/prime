Pretty rad interactive modular elements

Made with love at viam

### Getting started

PRIME is a collection of atomic UI elements, designed to "just work" in any HTML-based environment, regardless of framework or lack thereof. It is a web component library.

The PRIME NPM package contains the following necessary exports for usage:
* `prime.es.js` or `prime.umd.js` - JS that defines custom elements. ES modules are recommended over UMD.
* `prime.css` - stylesheet shared by all elements.

If the necessary `.css` and `.js` files have been added to your HTML document, then no additional imports are needed!
You can immediately start adding PRIME elements to your app:

```html
<b-button label='Hello world!' />
```
