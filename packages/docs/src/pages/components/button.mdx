## Button text

- **Button text should be clear, unambiguous, and brief.** Except for certain cases where the object is obvious and a verb alone can suffice, a good formula for clear button text is “`verb` + `noun` .”
- **Use sentence case for button text.** Only capitalize the first word (with the exception of proper nouns).

## Variants

As a general rule, pages should have a single primary button for the highest-priority action. This button should be accompanied by secondary or tertiary buttons for the lower-priority actions.

| Primary | For the single most important user action on a page or part of the interface. There should never be multiple primary buttons competing for the user’s attention. |
| --- | --- |
| Secondary | For secondary actions. Most actions on a page should use this variant. Often used in conjunction with primary buttons. |
| Tertiary | For lowest-priority actions. (These are also called “ghost buttons,” since they have no fill color or border.) |

## Buttons with icons

Icons can be used to clarify button text and help the user quickly skim a page. Icons should always be `white` in primary buttons and `gray-6` in secondary and tertiary buttons.

For buttons that only contain an icon, see the [IconButton element](https://prime.viam.com/?path=/docs/elements-iconbutton--docs).

## Button groups

Groups of buttons should be arranged horizontally and have a gap of `8px` .

## Destructive buttons

For actions that can affect a user’s data, use destructive button variants. Like regular buttons, destructive buttons have variants that indicate the importance of the action.

| Caution | For destructive (but not critical) actions that could affect a user’s data. |
| --- | --- |
| Danger | For critical destructive actions. Use sparingly. Always clearly specify the object that will be affected (ex: say “Delete organization,” not “Delete”). |

## Disabled states

As a rule of thumb, we try to avoid using disabled buttons because [they have poor accessibility and can create a frustrating user experience](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/08/frustrating-design-patterns-disabled-buttons/). 

When unavoidable, **disabled buttons should always include some indication of why the action is blocked**, like helper text under the button or an explanatory tooltip on hover.
